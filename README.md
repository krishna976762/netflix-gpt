## About the App

This app utilizes Google Firebase for user login and authentication. It features a UI similar to Netflix, where the movie database is sourced from themoviedb.org. The app fetches data from the API and uses Redux to manage the application's state. Routing is used to navigate between different pages, and custom hooks are employed to fetch data efficiently, avoiding unnecessary API calls when data is already available.

The main functionality of this app is the integration with OpenAI's GPT. Users can search for movie genres using GPT, which provides suggestions based on user input. These suggestions are then displayed to the user.
